  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
   config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
  #   # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  #   vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
      vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
   end
